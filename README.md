## 📖 Introduction

**ICRAM** is a modern, distraction-free productivity web application designed to help users maintain focus and manage their time effectively. Built with a stunning **Glassmorphism** UI, it combines essential productivity tools—Pomodoro timers, stopwatches, task tracking, and an integrated background music player—into a single, aesthetic interface.

Whether you are coding, studying for exams, or working on creative projects, ICRAM provides the perfect environment to get into the "flow" state.
